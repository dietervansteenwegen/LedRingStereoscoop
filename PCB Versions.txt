*** v0.1 -> v0.2 ***
- Silkscreen positions
- pull up U3 _shutDown

*** v0.2 -> v0.3 ***
- diode between pull up and _MCLR was reversed. Corrected.
- SCL on correct uC pin (does not support PPS)
- moved TP1 to RA0
- Added J4 to allow current measurement in-circuit
- Silkscreen for VCC in range (4-7V)
- Rotary encoder: removed solder jumper (hardwired to Vcc), pull down resistors on each separate output
- Silkscreen for DC/BATT connectors and ON/OFF on top (bottom) side
- LED footprints corrected
- LED Anodes connected to switched power, not directly to batt
- Replaced resitor divider to higher values (lower current draw)
- ~Charging moved to more logical pin


TODO (for v0.3): 
- Check if pull up/down resistors on rotary encoder are already changed so that bodge wires aren't necessery anymore.
- LDO aanpassen
- Rext (?)
